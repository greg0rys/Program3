//
// we need to create a base class user, and derive a contact from it
// in the working application the user will have a contact list stored as a
// red-black tree using the contacts tag as the nodes key in the tree

// the contact will also benefit from inheriting from the user because it
// can inherit the values name etc from the user and then the contact
// can have the data member for the preferred contact type.
